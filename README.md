# About this project

This project was originally created to be a dynamic full stack portfolio website. I adjusted it to host it on GitHub Pages.

### Learn about me

I hope this website gives you the opportunity to learn a little bit about me!

## Run it locally

Use a code editor (or don't), then in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install` or `npm i`

This will install the project dependencies in a node_modules folder.

Then in the project directory run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (unless otherwise specified) to view it in your browser.

A React feature is that the page will reload when you make changes.
